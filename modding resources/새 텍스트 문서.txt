Unlocking units is a story event. Locking units is also a story event.
Story events are only available to the main three factions
You can trigger story events off of the completion of LUA functions, and vice versa. Usually EAWX story LUA scripts are used to trigger story events relating to dummy constructions
Though you can use story events to check for the construction of dummy objects and also delete them. Presumably LUA is more reliable or offers finer control or something.
If you want to see examples of unit locks and unlocks, there should be a series of XML documents for TR with universal lock in the name
That script controls how the new class ships for the new Republic are unlocked and the old ships are locked on certain era transitions
